## Reporting a Vulnerability

We take the security of our software seriously. If you believe you have found a security vulnerability, please report it to us as described below.

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, email the project maintainers.

Provide us with as much information as possible, so we can reproduce and understand the issue. Normally, the following information is useful:

- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept
- Any relevant logs or output
- Your assessment of the impact and severity of the issue

We will endeavor to respond quickly, and may ask for additional information or guidance.

Depending on the severity of the issue, we may release a security update, provide a workaround, or ask for a coordinated public disclosure. 

All valid reported security vulnerabilities will be addressed. Please give us a reasonable amount of time to address the issue before publishing it elsewhere. Following these steps will ensure your report is promptly received and handled appropriately.
