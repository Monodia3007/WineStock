# Contributing to WineStock

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

This document provides guidelines for contributing to the WineStock project.

## How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

This section guides you through submitting a bug report. Following these guidelines helps maintainers and the community
understand your report, reproduce the behavior, and find related reports.

#### Before Submitting A Bug Report

* **Determine which repository the problem should be reported in**.
* **Perform a cursory search** to see if the problem has already been reported. If it has, add a comment to the existing
  issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Bug Report?

Bugs are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue and provide the following information:

* Use a clear and descriptive title
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and why you consider this problematic
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why
* State if you're working with a particular dataset

### Suggesting Enhancements

This section guides you through submitting an enhancement suggestion, including completely new features and minor
improvements to existing functionality.

#### Before Submitting An Enhancement Suggestion

* **Check the README.md and docs** Your idea might already be implemented
* **Perform a cursory search** to see if the enhancement has already been suggested. If it has, add a comment to the
  existing issue instead of opening a new one.

#### How Do I Submit A (Good) Enhancement Suggestion?

Enhancement suggestions are tracked as GitHub issues. Create an issue and provide:

* **Use a clear and descriptive title**
* **Provide a step-by-step description of the suggested enhancement** in as much detail as possible
* **Describe the current behavior** and **explain which behavior you expected to see instead** and why

## Code Contribution

### Fork the repository and make changes as you'd like.

If you'd simply like to fix a bug you found, that's awesome! Make your changes and propose a Pull Request.

If you'd like to add a feature, it's suggested to create an issue first to discuss it.

### Pull Requests

* Fill in the required template
* Provide details about the changes, tests you've performed, and any other relevant information
* Include the relevant issue number if applicable

## Styleguides

### Git Commit Messages

* Use the present tense ("add feature" not "added feature")
* Use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
* Limit the first line to 72 characters or less
* Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### Java Styleguide

All Java code must adhere to the [Google Java Styleguide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html). Adherence
will be verified using IntelliJ IDEA code formatting.

## Any contributions you make will be under the MIT Software License

In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the
same [MIT License](http://choosealicense.com/licenses/mit/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the
maintainers if that's a concern.
